| 0.0.x   | ❌        | No               |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security issues publicly or via GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Method: Private Disclosure

1. **Email**: Send detailed reports to `security@vortexhash.org`
2. **PGP Encryption**: For sensitive information, encrypt your report using our PGP key:

```
pub   rsa4096 2025-01-01 [SC]
       ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12
uid           [ultimate] VortexHash Security Team <security@vortexhash.org>
sub   rsa4096 2025-01-01 [E]
```

3. **What to Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact assessment
   - Proposed fix (if available)
   - Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Coordination**: Working with reporter to develop patch
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter after fix is available

## Bug Bounty Program

We offer rewards for responsibly disclosed security vulnerabilities:

| Severity | Reward |
|----------|--------|
| Critical | $10,000 |
| High     | $5,000  |
| Medium   | $1,000  |
| Low      | $250    |

### Eligible Vulnerabilities

- Remote code execution
- Denial of service that affects core functionality
- Cryptographic primitive weaknesses
- Side-channel attacks (timing, cache, power analysis)
- Memory safety violations in core primitives

### Ineligible Reports

- Denial of service in test utilities
- Rate limiting issues
- Self-XSS or obvious authentication issues
- Previously known vulnerabilities
- Missing HTTP security headers

## Disclosure Policy

We follow [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) principles:

1. **Private Communication**: All discussions remain private between reporter and maintainers
2. **Fix Development**: Work with reporter to develop and test fix
3. **Credit**: Reporter credited in release notes unless anonymity requested
4. **Public Disclosure**: Full disclosure after fix is available, typically 90 days
5. **Exceptional Cases**: Immediate disclosure for actively exploited vulnerabilities

## Cryptographic Security Considerations

### Algorithm Security

VortexHash provides the following security properties:

- **Preimage Resistance**: 2^128 security level
- **Second Preimage Resistance**: 2^128 security level  
- **Collision Resistance**: 2^128 security level
- **Side-Channel Resistance**: Constant-time implementation
- **Quantum Resistance**: Designed for post-quantum security

### Implementation Security

- **Memory Safety**: Full Rust implementation, no unsafe code in core primitives
- **Automatic Zeroization**: All sensitive data automatically zeroized using `zeroize`
- **Constant-Time Operations**: All comparisons and operations are constant-time
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

### Known Limitations

⚠️ **VortexHash is experimental software and has not undergone formal cryptanalysis.**

- Use only in development or test environments
- Production use requires external security review
- Not suitable for high-value cryptographic applications without validation

## Auditing and Review

### External Audits

We are actively seeking external security audits from qualified cryptographic review firms.

### Community Review

All cryptographic changes undergo:
1. **Internal Review**: By core maintainers with cryptographic expertise
2. **External Review**: At least two independent reviews before merging
3. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs for critical properties
4. **Fuzz Testing**: Continuous fuzzing of public interfaces

### Continuous Security Testing

- **Static Analysis**: `cargo clippy` and `cargo-audit`
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Address sanitizer and memory sanitizer
- **Fuzzing**: `cargo-fuzz` for input validation
- **Benchmark Security**: Performance tests that verify constant-time behavior

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Use Secure Configuration**:
```rust
let config = SecurityConfig::default()
    .with_constant_time(true)
    .with_side_channel_protection(true);
```

2. **Validate Inputs**:
```rust
if !vortex_hash::utilities::validate_input(data) {
    return Err("Invalid input data");
}
```

3. **Zeroize Sensitive Data**:
```rust
use zeroize::Zeroize;
let mut key = [0u8; 32];
// ... use key ...
key.zeroize();
```

### For System Integrators

1. **Feature Selection**: Enable only necessary features to minimize attack surface
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep VortexHash updated to receive security patches
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual performance patterns that may indicate side-channel attacks
4. **Key Management**: Use secure key generation and storage practices
